(1) Sure, I'd be happy to explain this code! It's a Python script that checks the validity of a list of email addresses using an API.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:
<h1>import requests  </h1>

(2) This line imports the requests module, which is a popular choice for making HTTP requests in Python.
<h1> filename = input("[+] Enter List :") </h1>

(3) This line prompts the user to enter the name of a file that contains a list of email addresses, one per line. The name of the file is then stored in the variable filename.
<h1>print("[!] Start Check Emails Just Wait... [!]") </h1>

(4) This line prints a message to the console to let the user know that the script is starting to check the email addresses.
<h1>email1 = [line.strip() for line in open(f"{filename}")] </h1>

(5) This line opens the file specified by the user and reads each line (i.e., each email address) into a list called email1. The strip() function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each email address.
<h1>for emails in email1:
    url = f'https://gmailcheck.pythonanywhere.com/?gmail={emails}'
    req = requests.get(url)
    getav = req.json()["check"]
    print(f"{emails}"+ " : "+getav)</h1>

This is the main loop of the script, where each email address in the email1 list is checked for validity. For each email address, the script constructs a URL that includes the email address as a query parameter, and then sends an HTTP GET request to that URL using the requests.get() function. The response from the API is then parsed as JSON, and the value of the check key is extracted and printed to the console along with the original email address.

Overall, this script is a simple but effective way to check the validity of a list of email addresses using an external API.
